IDEAS
  - document pbsCancel and pbsComponent
  - maybe use Permissions on user service view
  - redo the virtual services page to use pbsComponent

DYNAMICALLY RENDER PAGE
  /:spId/:gpId/:uId/:component?/:subcomponent?
  <pbs-component component="component" />

NOTE: perhaps that will be better for deep linking?
