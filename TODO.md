- fix flexible seating and all the different component names
- also look to remove the serviceInstanceProfile part as that is a component

TODO

- remove all redundant code - look for unused components (eg: domains, states, timezones)
- check that all files are registered to the correct module
- import only what is needed from lodash
- check for moment and move to Sugar-date
- why is google UA being initialized so many times?
- make an API component that has only our services that hit the API
- check that all the .css files are imported and possibly combine them
- split lots of things out into modules
